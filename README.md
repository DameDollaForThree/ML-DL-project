## Project 1: Indian house price prediction (ML)

- **Brief Introduction**: This project aims to explore and analyze the data of a set of features/factors relevant to Indian house price, find the relationships between these features and the house price, and build a machine learning model that is able to predict the approximate house prices in India given that set of features.

- **Problem Solving Approach**: exploratory data analysis (EDA), feature extraction, one-hot encoding, standard scaler
- **Model selection**: Random Forest Regressor, DecisionTree Regressor

- **Model's Accracy Score**: 90%



## Project 2: Chinese MNIST Classification (ML/DL)
